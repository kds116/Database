# Database
The goal of this project was to design and create an original database that stores data for a specific industry.

My project was based upon an airport where, I would design my own database and input my own information to assure the database is sufficient.

Google Cloud and MySQL Workbench were used to: design, create and populate a database based upon airport information data.

An ER Diagram was then engineered to ensure the logical structure was sound. 

Furthermore, AWS Cloud 9 was used to write a Python program that gave users a faster and more efficient way to access to the database.
Upon completion, the Python file was uploaded to a server via SSH connection.
