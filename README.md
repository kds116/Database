# Database
Google Cloud and MySQL Workbench were used to: design, create and populate a database based upon airport information data. 
An ER Diagram was then engineered to ensure the logical structure was sound. 
Furthermore, AWS Cloud 9 was used to write a Python program that gave users a faster and more efficient way to access to the database.
Upon completion, the Python file was uploaded to a server via SSH connection.
